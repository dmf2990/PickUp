This is our first React project which is fully separated from our Java backend, and it is currently in progress (very exciting). 
We are working on a project that will allow users to find individuals with pickup trucks to help them move (similar to uber model).
Basic functionality: posting new orders, drivers being able to accept orders, and connecting backend to React front. 
The primary goal of this project is to gain familiarity building React front end projects, and linking them to our Java Spring MVC API.
